# Servus!

My name is Tam치s G치l, I am an astroparticle physicist and working on my PhD at the Erlangen Centre for Astroparticle Physics [**ECAP**](https://ecap.nat.fau.de/).
I currently develop online monitoring and live reconstruction algorithms for the [**KM3NeT**](https://www.km3net.org) neutrino telescopes.
I spend most of my time with science (astroparticle physics), coding (Julia, Python, ...) and electronics (both analog/digital); the rest preferably off the road with one of my motorbikes. I have an obsession to repair things and keep them alive as long as possible, no matter if it requires a gearbox restoration of my BMW R1100 GS or replacing a dead 0201 SMD capacitor on a MacBook logicboard.

I occasionally publish some content on YouTube: electronics repair videos, live coding and some other tiny video projects for fun, but I plan to start a series of DIY videos not only about electronics but also about modular synthesizers, which I am currently exploring. This is a topic I really enjoy and looking forward to gain and share experience.

# Servus!

My name is Tam치s G치l, I am a physicist and working on my PhD at the Erlangen Centre for Astroparticle Physics [**ECAP**](https://ecap.nat.fau.de/).
I currently develop online monitoring and live reconstruction algorithms for the [**KM3NeT**](https://www.km3net.org) neutrino telescopes.
In addition to that, I work as a freelancer programmer and graphic designer.
